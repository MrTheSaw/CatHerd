#  Swiftcat

### A poor version of cat(1) written in Swift 5.2

Here's a decently worked out swift cat. My main goal (other than a fun day coding) was to stick to strictly Swift idioms. There's no getline(3), no NSRegularExpression, and no UnsafeBuffer usage, things I saw in other file trawling code for Swift. Not that there's anything wrong with that... well, NSRegularExpression is a mess, but that aside, it is a workable solution.

My main concern was streaming to file in a swiftian manner, to get an idea of what is required, and I think the result is reasonably readable, and not too esoteric.

In My Humble Opinion, of course, Bob.

Anyway, enjoy. Feel free to send me fix or ideas.
